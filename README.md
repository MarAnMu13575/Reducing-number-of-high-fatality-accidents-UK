# Reducing the Number of High Fatality Accidents

## Purpose

The purpose of this report is to gain insights from a database published by the UK Department for Transport on road accidents in 2020. The main focus is to identify patterns and characteristics of major incidents, defined as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties, in order to provide recommendations for reducing their occurrence and minimizing their impact.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Database Description

The data used in this report was published by the UK Department for Transport and contains information on road accidents reported in 2020. The dataset is a part of public sector information and is licensed under the Open Government License v3.0.

## Introduction

In 2020, the UK recorded a total of 1,516 road accident fatalities, with 1,460 deaths reported in Britain and 56 in Northern Ireland. This number showed a significant decline compared to previous years, partly attributed to the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, from 2012 to 2019, the number of road deaths plateaued at around 1,850 deaths per year, averaging five deaths per day. The count of serious injuries, though slightly declining since 2010, still remains high at over 22,000 serious injuries annually, equivalent to around 60 per day (Brake, 2021).

The focus of this report is to analyze the data collected on every accident reported in 2020 and identify insights that can help reduce the number of major incidents, specifically fatal accidents involving 3 or more casualties.

## Time of Day and Day of the Week for Major Accidents

Analyzing the time of day and day of the week when major incidents occur can provide valuable insights into potential contributing factors and help devise strategies to address them.

## Patterns in Time of Day / Day of the Week for Major Incidents

Identifying patterns in the timing of major incidents can help in understanding if there are specific periods or circumstances that are more prone to such accidents.

## Stand Out Characteristics in Major Incidents vs. Other Accidents

Comparing major incidents with other accidents in terms of contributing factors, locations, vehicle types, weather conditions, etc., can reveal standout characteristics that may require targeted interventions.

## Recommendations to Focus Brainstorming for Reducing Major Incidents

Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, specific recommendations will be provided to focus brainstorming efforts aimed at reducing major incidents and improving overall road safety.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the UK Department for Transport's road accident data for 2020 has provided valuable insights into major incidents and factors contributing to their occurrence. By understanding the patterns and characteristics of such accidents, we can formulate targeted strategies to reduce their frequency and mitigate their impact on road safety.
